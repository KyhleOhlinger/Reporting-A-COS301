Okay so this is pretty simple to use!

HOW TO RUN MONGODB:
1) go to mongo db folder and traverse to the bin folder(typically ...../Prgoram Files/MongoDB/Server/3.0/Bin)
2) This step can be done two ways, the first way may not work the first time:
	First way:
	1) Double click on Mongod.exe
	2) Double click on Mongo.exe
	NOTE: this will open up two console menus which should be open for the whole time that my program is running. If the consoles close 
	automatically after you run them then try the second way of staring mongo db

	Second way:
	1) In the folder, shift+right-click and select "Open Command window here" and then type "mongod.exe" and press enter. Do not exit the console window!!!
	2) In the folder, shift+right-click and select "Open Command window here" and then type "mongo.exe" and press enter. Do not exit any of the console windows!!!

3) After step two procede to finding the executable of the project I have sent you. this will be located in he debug folder contained with in the bin file.
4) Run the Executable "Homework6.exe" (sorry for the name, I edited another assignment)
5) A message and funny screen should appear saying that data has been added to the database.
6) You can now exit the program and continue with life as normal.


Notes: 
1) Please refer to the information I sent with the design of the database.
2) Feel free to look at this projects code if you can, you can use Visual Studio to do this.
3) Please let me know if you wish to know about anything else.
